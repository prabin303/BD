        <h1>Happy Birthday, Sunshine!</h1>
        <div class="poem">
            You're my sunshine, my favorite sight,<br>
            My morning thought, my dreams at night.<br>
            Today’s your day, and I just hope you see,<br>
            How much you truly mean to me.<br><br>
            
            Through every laugh and every smile,<br>
            With you, life feels a little worthwhile.<br>
            So here's to you, on this special day,<br>
            In every possible, wonderful way.<br><br>
            
            I know I've caused you hurt and pain,<br>
            And I'd take it back, again and again.<br>
            Every sound and notification, I hope it's you—<br>
            You’re my heart, my home, my truth.<br><br>
            
            I know I stumble, I get things wrong,<br>
            But I miss you deeply, all day long.<br>
            I’ll work on myself, be better each day,<br>
            To never hurt you in any way.<br><br>
            
            I dream of being near you, close,<br>
            Though distance now keeps us apart.<br>
            But for a lifetime, I’ll be there,<br>
            With steady hands and open heart.<br><br>
            
            I’m learning love, I’m growing still,<br>
            To stand beside you, strong and true.<br>
            I work each day to be the one,<br>
            Deserving of a soul like you.<br><br>
            
            Through all our days, I’ll be the same,<br>
            Forever here, in love’s sweet name.<br><br>
            
            You've become my favorite place to be,<br>
            My happy thought, my harmony.<br>
            In all the world, there's no one I’d find,<br>
            Who could ever be so kind.<br><br>
            
            Every moment with you feels so right,<br>
            From sunrise glow to the starry night.<br>
            You are my joy, my heart's delight,<br>
            A love that sparkles, warm and bright.<br><br>
            
            So happy birthday, my dear, my love,<br>
            My favorite beginning, middle, and end.<br>
            May this year bring you endless cheer,<br>
            For you’re my favorite, year after year.
